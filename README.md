# Picture-in-Picture (PiP)

[Picture in Picture](git@github.com:mkturner/picture-in-picture.git) is a Web API that allows video player to be detached from the main browser window and continue playing video in background while user does other things.

This project is a quick Demo of the API.

## Gotchas

At the moment, this is only working in browsers that support the [Picture in Picture protocol](https://caniuse.com/picture-in-picture). 
I have tested and can confirm desired functionality in the current version of Google Chrome (v85 at time of writing).
